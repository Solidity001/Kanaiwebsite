            <h2>About KANAIDAO</h2>
            <p>KANAIDAO is an open-source project on the Ethereum blockchain and a
                Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The project is
                managed by people around the world who hold its governance token,
                KANAI(NAI). Through a system of scientific governance involving Executive
                Voting and Governance Polling, KANAI tokens (NAI) holders manage the KANAI Protocol and
                the financial risks of USTEBO to ensure its stability, transparency, and efficiency. KANAI voting weight
                is proportional to the amount of NAI a voter
                stakes in the voting contract. In other words, the more NAI tokens locked in
                the contract, the greater the voter’s decision-making power.</p>
            <h2>About the KANAI PROTOCOL</h2>
            <p>The KANAI Protocol, built on the Ethereum blockchain, enables users to
                create currency. Current elements of the KANAI Protocol are the USTEBO
                stablecoin, Collateral Vaults, Oracles, and Voting. KANAI DAO governs the
                KANAI Protocol by deciding on key parameters (e.g., stability fees, collateral
                rates, etc.) through the voting power of KANAI Token (NAI) holders.</p>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The USTEBO Stablecoin System, today called the KANAI Protocol, accepts
                Ethereum and Wrapped Bitcoin (WETH & WBTC) asset that has been
                approved by NAI holders, who also vote on corresponding Risk Parameters The USTEBO Stablecoin System,
                today called the KANAI Protocol, accepts
                Wrapped Ethereum and Wrapped Bitcoin (WETH & WBTC) asset that has been
                approved by NAI holders, who also vote on corresponding Risk Parameters for each collateral asset.
                Voting is a critical component of the KANAI
                decentralized governance process.</p>
            <p>Welcome to <b>Bi-Collateral USTEBO System (BUS).</b></p>
            <p><b>In BUS We Trust</b></p>
            <p>Blockchain technology provides an unprecedented opportunity to ease the
                public’s growing frustration with—and distrust of—dysfunctional centralized
                financial systems. By distributing data across a network of computers, the
                technology allows any group of individuals to embrace transparency rather
                than central-entity control. The result is an unbiased, transparent, and highly
                efficient permissionless system—one that can improve current global financial
                and monetary structures and better serve the public good.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin was created with this goal in mind. But, while Bitcoin succeeds as a
                cryptocurrency on a number of levels, it is not ideal as a medium of exchange
                because its fixed supply and speculative nature results in volatility, which
                prevents it from proliferating as mainstream money.</p>
            <p>The USTEBO stablecoin, on the other hand, succeeds where Bitcoin fails
                precisely because USTEBO is designed to minimize price volatility. A
                decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency that is soft-pegged
                to the US Dollar, USTEBO’s value is in its stability.</p>

            <p>After deploying to mainnet user adoption of the stablecoin is expected to rise
                dramatically and it will become a building block for decentralized applications
                that help expand the DeFi (decentralized finance) movement. USTEBO’s
                success will be part of a wider industry movement for stablecoins, which are
                cryptocurrencies designed to maintain price value and function like money.</p>
            <p>For example, in February 2019, JPMorgan became the first bank in the United
                States to create and test a digital coin that represents 1 USD. As the cryptocurrency industry grows,
                other banks, financial services companies, and
                even governments will create stable digital currencies (e.g., Central Bank
                Digital Currencies (CBDC)), as will large organizations outside of the finance
                sector. Facebook, for example, announced its plans for Libra, “a stable digital
                cryptocurrency that will be fully backed by a reserve of real assets,”4 in June
                2019. However, such proposals forfeit the core value proposition of blockchain
                technology: global adoption of a common infrastructure without a central
                authority or administrator that may abuse its influence.</p>
            <p>
            <h2><b>An Overview of the KANAI Protocol and Its
                    Features</b></h2>
            </p>
            <h3><b>The KANAI Protocol</b></h3>
            <p>The KANAI Protocol will be one of the largest dapps on the Ethereum
                blockchain.
                Designed by a disparate group of contributors, including developers within the KANAI Foundation, its
                outside partners, and other persons and entities, is
                expected to see significant adoption.</p>
            <p>The KANAI Protocol is managed by people around the world who hold its
                governance token, KANAI Token (NAI). Through a system of scientific governance involving
                Executive Voting and Governance Polling, NAI holders govern the Protocol
                and the financial risks of USTEBO to ensure its stability, transparency, and
                efficiency. One NAI token locked in a voting contract equals one vote.</p>
            <h3><b>The USTEBO Stablecoin</b></h3>
            <p>The USTEBO stablecoin is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed
                cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar. USTEBO will be held in
                cryptocurrency wallets or within platforms, and is supported on Ethereum and
                other popular blockchains.</p>
            <p>USTEBO is easy to generate, access, and use. Users generate USTEBO by
                depositing collateral assets into KANAI Vaults within the KANAI Protocol. This
                is how USTEBO is entered into circulation and how users gain access to
                liquidity. Others will obtain USTEBO by buying it from brokers or exchanges,
                or simply by receiving it as a means of payment. Once generated, bought, or received, USTEBO can be used
                in the same
                manner as any other cryptocurrency: it can be sent to others, used as
                payments for goods and services, and even held as savings. Every USTEBO in circulation is directly
                backed
                by excess collateral, meaning
                that the value of the collateral is higher than the value of the USTEBO debt,
                and all USTEBO transactions are publicly viewable on the Ethereum
                blockchain.</p>
            <h3><b>What Properties of USTEBO Function Similarly to Money?</b></h3>
            <p>Generally, money has four functions: A store of value, Medium of exchange, Unit of account and a standard
                of deferred payment.</p>
            <p>USTEBO has properties and use cases designed to serve these functions.</p>
            <h4><b>USTEBO as a Store of Value</b></h4>
            <p>A store of value is an asset that keeps its value without significant depreciation
                over time. Because USTEBO is a stablecoin, it is designed to function as a
                store of value even in a volatile market.</p>
            <h4><b>USTEBO as a Medium of Exchange</b></h4>
            <p>A medium of exchange is anything that represents a standard of value and is
                used to facilitate the sale, purchase, or exchange (trade) of goods or services. The USTEBO stablecoin
                will be used around the world for all types of
                transactional purposes.</p>
            <h4><b>USTEBO as a Unit of Account</b></h4>
            <p>A unit of account is a standardized measurement of value used to price goods
                and services (e.g., USD, EUR, YEN). Currently, USTEBO has a target price of
                1USD (1 USTB = 1 USD). While USTEBO is not used as a standard
                measurement of value in the off-chain world, it functions as a unit of account
                within the KANAI Protocol and some blockchain dapps, whereby KANAI
                Protocol accounting or pricing of dapp services is in USTEBO rather than a fiat
                currency like USD.</p>
            <h4><b>USTEBO as a Standard of Deferred Payment</b></h4>
            <p>USTEBO is used to settle debts within the KANAI Protocol (e.g., users use
                USTEBO to pay the stability fee and close their Vaults). This benefit separates
                USTEBO from other stablecoins.</p>
            <h3><b>Collateral Assets</b></h3>
            <p>USTEBO is generated, backed, and kept stable through collateral assets that
                are deposited into KANAI Vaults on the KANAI Protocol. A collateral asset is a
                digital asset that NAI holders have voted to accept into the Protocol currently
                is WETH & WBTC.
                To generate USTEBO, the KANAI Protocol accepts WETH and WBTC. NAI
                holders also must also approve specific, corresponding Risk Parameters for
                each accepted collateral (e.g., more stable assets might get more lenient Risk
                Parameters, while more risky assets could get stricter Risk Parameters).
                Detailed information on Risk Parameters is below. These and other decisions
                of NAI holders are made through the KANAI decentralized governance
                process.</p>
            <h3>KANAI Vaults</h3>
            <P>All accepted collateral assets can be leveraged to generate USTEBO in the
                KANAI Protocol through smart contracts called KANAI Vaults. Users can
                access the KANAI Protocol and create Vaults through a number of different
                user interface . Creating a Vault is not complicated, but generating USTEBO
                does create an obligation to repay the USTEBO, along with a stability Fee, in order to withdraw the
                collateral leveraged and locked inside a
                Vault. Vaults are inherently non-custodial: Users interact with Vaults and the KANAI
                Protocol directly, and each user has complete and independent control over
                their deposited collateral as long the value of that collateral doesn’t fall below
                the required minimum level (the Liquidation Ratio, discussed in detail below).</P>
            <h4>Interacting with a KANAI Vault</h4>
            <h4>Step 1: Create and Collateralize a Vault</h4>
            <p>A user creates a Vault via the interface by funding it with a specific type
                and amount of collateral that will be used to generate USTEBO at the
                moment is WETH and WBTC. Once funded, a Vault is considered
                collateralized.</p>
            <h4>Step 2: Generate USTEBO from the Collateralized Vault</h4>
            <p>The Vault owner initiates a transaction, and then confirms it in his/her
                unhosted cryptocurrency wallet in order to generate a specific amount
                of USTEBO in exchange for keeping his/her collateral locked in the
                Vault.</p>
            <h4>Step 3: Pay Down the Debt and the Stability Fee</h4>
            <p>To retrieve a portion or all of the collateral, a Vault owner must pay down
                or completely pay back the USTEBO he/she generated, plus the
                Stability Fee that continuously accrues on the USTEBO outstanding.
                The Stability Fee can only be paid in USTEBO.</p>
            <h4>Step 4: Withdraw Collateral</h4>
            <p>With the USTEBO returned and the Stability Fee paid, the Vault owner
                can withdraw all or some of his/her collateral back to their wallet. Once
                all USTEBO is completely returned and all collateral is retrieved, the
                Vault remains empty until the owner chooses to make another deposit.</p>
            <p>Importantly, each collateral asset deposited requires its own Vault. So, some
                users will own multiple Vaults with different types of collateral and levels of
                collateralization.</p>
            <h4>Liquidation of Risky KANAI Vaults</h4>
            <p>To ensure there is always enough collateral in the KANAI Protocol to cover the
                value of all outstanding debt (the amount of USTEBO outstanding valued at
                the Target Price), any KANAI Vault deemed too risky (according to parameters
                established by KANAI Governance) is liquidated through automated KANAI
                Protocol auctions. The Protocol makes the determination after comparing the
                Liquidation Ratio to the current collateral-to-debt ratio of a Vault. Each Vault
                type has its own Liquidation Ratio, and each ratio is determined by NAI voters
                based on the risk profile of the particular collateral asset type.</p>
            <h4>KANAI Protocol Auctions</h4>
            <p>The auction mechanisms of the KANAI Protocol enable the system to liquidate
                Vaults even when price information for the collateral is unavailable. At the point
                of liquidation, the KANAI Protocol takes the liquidated Vault collateral and
                subsequently sells it using an internal market-based auction mechanism. This
                is a <b>Collateral Auction.</b> The USTEBO received from the Collateral Auction is used to cover the
                Vault’s
                outstanding obligations, including payment of the Liquidation Penalty fee set
                by NAI voters for that specific Vault collateral type.If enough USTEBO is bid in the Collateral Auction
                to fully cover the Vault
                obligations plus the Liquidation Penalty, that auction converts to a <b>Reverse
                    Collateral Auction</b> in an attempt to sell as little collateral as possible.
            <p>Any
                leftover collateral is returned to the original Vault owner. If the Collateral Auction does not raise
                enough USTEBO to cover the Vault’s
                outstanding obligation, the deficit is converted into Protocol debt. Protocol debt
                is covered by the USTEBO in the KANAI Buffer. If there is not enough
                USTEBO in the Buffer, the Protocol triggers a <b>Debt Auction.</b> During a Debt
                Auction, NAI is minted by the system (increasing the amount of NAI in
                circulation), and then sold to bidders for USTEBO.</p>
            </p>
            <p>USTEBO proceeds from the Collateral Auction go into the KANAI Buffer, which
                serves as a buffer against an increase of NAI overall supply that could result from future uncovered
                Collateral Auctions and the accrual of the USTEBO
                Savings Rate (discussed in detail below)</p>
            <p>If USTEBO proceeds from auctions and Stability Fee payments exceed the
                KANAI Buffer limit (a number set by KANANI Governance), they are sold
                through a Surplus Auction. During a Surplus Auction, bidders compete by
                bidding decreasing amounts of NAI to receive a fixed amount of USTEBO.
                Once the <b>Surplus Auction</b> has ended, the KANAI Protocol autonomously
                destroys the NAI collected, thereby reducing the total NAI supply.</p>
            <h5>Example (Collateral Auction Process):</h5>
            <p>A large Vault becomes undercollateralized due to market conditions. An
                Auction Keeper then detects the undercollateralized Vault opportunity and
                initiates liquidation of the Vault, which kicks off a Collateral Auction for, say, 50
                WETH. Each Auction Keeper has a <b>bidding model</b> to assist in winning auctions. A
                bidding model includes a price at which to bid for the collateral (WETH, in this
                example). The Auction Keeper uses the token price from its bidding model as
                the basis for its bids in the first phase of a Collateral Auction, where increasing
                USTEBO bids are placed for the set amount of collateral. This amount
                represents the price of the total USTEBO wanted from the collateral auction.</p>
            <p>Now, let's say the Auction Keeper bids 5,000 USTEBO for the 50 WETH to
                meet this amount. The USTEBO bid is transferred from the Vault Engine to the
                Collateral Auction contract. With enough USTEBO in the Collateral Auction
                contract to cover the system's debt plus the Liquidation Penalty, the first phase
                of the Collateral Auction is over. In order to reach the price defined in its bidding model, the Auction
                Keeper
                submits a bid in the second phase of the Collateral Auction. In this phase, the
                objective is to return as much of the collateral to the Vault owner as the market
                will allow. The bids that the Auction Keepers place are for fixed USTEBO
                amounts and decreasing amounts of WETH. For instance, the bidding model of the Keeper in this example
                seeks a bid price of 125 USTEBO per ETH, so it
                offers
                5000 USTEBO for 40 ETH. Additional USTEBO for this bid is transferred from
                the Vault Engine to the Collateral Auction contract. After the bid duration limit is
                reached and the bid expires, the Auction Keeper claims the winning bid and
                settles the completed Collateral Auction by collecting the won collateral.</p>
            <h3>Key External Actors</h3>
            <p>In addition to its smart contract infrastructure, the KANAI Protocol involves
                groups of external actors to maintain operations: Keepers, Oracles, and
                Global Settlers (Emergency Oracles), and KANAI community members.
                Keepers take advantage of the economic incentives presented by the
                Protocol; Oracles and Global Settlers are external actors with special
                permissions in the system assigned to them by NAI voters; and KANAI
                community members are individuals and organizations that provide services.</p>
            <h4>Keepers</h4>
            <p>A Keeper is an independent (usually automated) actor that is incentivized by
                arbitrage opportunities to provide liquidity in various aspects of a decentralized
                system. In the KANAI Protocol, Keepers are market participants that dep
                USTEBO maintain its Target Price ($1): they sell USTEBO when the market
                price is above the Target Price, and buy USTEBO when the market price is
                below the Target Price. Keepers participate in Surplus Auctions, Debt
                Auctions, and Collateral Auctions when KANAI Vaults are liquidated.</p>
            <h4>Price Oracles</h4>
            <p>The KANAI Protocol requires real-time information about the market price of
                the collateral assets in KANAI Vaults in order to know when to trigger
                Liquidations. The Protocol derives its internal collateral prices from a decentralized Oracl e
                infrastructure that consists of a broad set of individual nodes called Oracle Feeds. NAI voters choose a
                set of trusted Feeds to deliver price information to
                the system through Ethereum transactions. They also control how many
                Feeds are in the set. To protect the system from an attacker attempting to gain control of a majority
                of the Oracles, the KANAI Protocol receives price inputs through the Oracle
                Security Module (OSM), not from the Oracles directly. The OSM, which is a
                layer of defense between the Oracles and the Protocol, delays a price for one
                hour, allowing Emergency Oracles or a KANAI Governance vote to freeze an
                Oracle if it is compromised. Decisions regarding Emergency
                Oracles and the price delay duration are made by NAI holders.
            </p>
            <h4>Emergency Oracles</h4>
            <p>Emergency Oracles are selected by NAI voters and act as a last line of
                defense against an attack on the governance process or on other Oracles.
                Emergency Oracles are able to freeze individual Oracles (e.g., ETH and BAT
                Oracles) to mitigate the risk of a large number of customers trying to withdraw
                their assets from the KANAI Protocol in a short period of time, as they have
                the authority to unilaterally trigger an Emergency Shutdown.</p>
            <h4>DAO Teams </h4>
            <P>consist of individuals and service providers, who may be
                contracted through KANAI Governance to provide specific services to
                KANAIDAO. Members of DAO teams are independent market actors and are
                not employed by the KANAI Foundation. The flexibility of KANAI Governance allows the KANAI community to
                adapt the
                DAO team framework to suit the services needed by the ecosystem based on
                real-world performance and emerging challenges. <br>Examples of DAO team member roles are the Governance
                Facilitator, who
                supports the communication infrastructure and processes of governance, and
                Risk Team members, who support KANAI Governance with financial risk
                research and draft proposals for onboarding new collateral and regulating
                existing collateral. While the KANAI Foundation has bootstrapped KANAI Governance it is
                anticipated that the DAO will take full control, conduct NAI votes, and fill these
                varied DAO team roles in the near future.</P>
            <h3>The USTEBO Savings Rate</h3>
            <p>The USTEBO Savings Rate (USR) allows any USTEBO holder to earn
                savings automatically and natively by locking their USTEBO into the USR
                contract in the KANAI Protocol. It can be accessed via the interface into the
                KANAI Protocol. Users aren’t required to deposit a minimum amount to earn
                the USR, and they can withdraw any or all of their USTEBO from the USR
                contract at any time.</p>
            <p>The USR is a global system parameter that determines the amount USTEBO
                holders earn on their savings over time. When the market price of USTEBO
                deviates from the Target Price due to changing market dynamics, NAI holders
                can mitigate the price instability by voting to modify the USR accordingly:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>● If the market price of USTEBO is above 1 USD, NAI holders can choose
                to gradually decrease the USR, which will reduce demand and should
                reduce the market price of USTEBO toward the 1 USD Target Price.<br>
                ● If the market price of USTEBO is below 1 USD, NAI holders can choose
                to gradually increase the USR, which will stimulate demand and should
                increase the market price of USTEBO toward the 1 USD Target Price.</ul>
            </p>
            <p>Initially, adjustment of the USR will depend on a weekly process, whereby NAI
                holders first evaluate and discuss public market data and proprietary data
                provided by market participants, and then vote on whether an adjustment is
                necessary or not. The long-term plan includes implementation of the USR
                Adjustment Module, an Instant Access Module that directly controls both the
                USR and the Base Rate. This module allows for easy adjustment of the USR
                (within strict size and frequency boundaries set by NAI holders) by an NAI
                holder on behalf of the larger group of NAI holders. The motivation behind this
                plan is to enable nimble responses to rapidly changing market conditions, and to avoid overuse of the
                standard governance process of Executive Voting and
                Governance Polling.</p>
            <h3>Governance of the KANAI Protocol</h3>
            <h4>Use of the NAI Token in KANAI Governance</h4>
            <p>The NAI token—the governance token of the KANAI Protocol—allows those
                who hold it to vote on changes to the KANAI Protocol. Note that anyone, not
                only NAI holders, can submit proposals for an NAI vote. Any voter-approved modifications to the
                governance variables of the Protocol
                will likely not take effect immediately in the future; rather, they could be
                delayed by as much as 24 hours if voters choose to activate the Governance
                Security Module (GSM). The delay would give NAI holders the opportunity to
                protect the system, if necessary, against a malicious governance proposal
                (e.g., a proposal that alters collateral parameters contrary to established
                monetary policies or that allows for security mechanisms to be disabled) by
                triggering a Shutdown.</p>
            <h4>Polling and Executive Voting</h4>
            <p>In practice, the KANAI Governance process includes proposal polling and
                Executive Voting. Proposal polling is conducted to establish a rough
                consensus of community sentiment before any Executive Votes are cast. This
                helps to ensure that governance decisions are considered throughtfully and
                reached by consensus prior to the voting process itself. Executive Voting is
                held to approve (or not) changes to the state of the system. An example of an
                Executive Vote could be a vote to ratify Risk Parameters for a newly accepted
                collateral type. At a technical level, smart contracts manage each type of vote. A Proposal
                Contract is a smart contract with one or more valid governance actions
                programmed into it. It can only be executed once. When executed, it
                immediately applies its changes to the internal governance variables of the
                KANAI Protocol. After execution, the Proposal Contract cannot be reused. Any Ethereum Address can deploy
                valid Proposal Contracts. NAI token
                holders can then cast approval votes for the proposal that they want to elect
                as the Active Proposal. The Ethereum address that has the highest number of
                approval votes is elected as the Active Proposal. The Active Proposal is
                empowered to gain administrative access to the internal governance variables
                of the KANAI Protocol, and then modify them.</p>
            <h4>The KANAI(NAI) Token’s Role in Recapitalization</h4>
            <p>In addition to its role in KANAI Governance, the NAI token has a
                complementary role as the recapitalization resource of the KANAI Protocol. If
                the system debt exceeds the surplus, the NAI token supply may increase
                through a Debt Auction (see above) to recapitalize the system. This risk
                inclines NAI holders to align and responsibly govern the KANAI ecosystem to
                avoid excessive risk-taking.</p>
            <h5>NAI Holder Responsibilities</h5>
            <p>NAI holders can vote to do the following:<br>
            <ul>● Add a new collateral asset type with a unique set of Risk Parameters.<br>
                ● Change the Risk Parameters of one or more existing collateral asset
                types, or add new Risk Parameters to one or more existing collateral
                asset types.<br>
                ● Modify the USTEBO Savings Rate.<br>
                ● Choose the set of Oracle Feeds.<br>
                ● Choose the set of Emergency Oracles.<br>
                ● Trigger Emergency Shutdown.<br>
                ● Upgrade the system.</ul>
            </p>
            <p>NAI holders can also allocate funds from the KANAI Buffer to pay for various
                infrastructure needs and services, including Oracle infrastructure and
                collateral risk management research. The funds in the KANAI Buffer are
                revenues from Stability Fees, Liquidation Fees, and other income streams. The governance mechanism of
                the KANAI Protocol is designed to be as
                flexible as possible, and upgradeable. Should the system mature under the guidance of the community,
                more advanced forms of Proposal Contracts
                could, in theory, be used, including Proposal Contracts that are bundled. For
                example, one proposal contract may contain both an adjustment of a Stability
                Fee and an adjustment of the USR. Nonetheless, those revisions will remain
                for NAI holders to decide.</p>
            <h5>Risk Parameters Controlled by KANAI Governance</h5>
            <p>Each KANAI Vault type (e.g., WETH Vault and WBTC Vault) has its own
                unique set of Risk Parameters that enforce usage. The parameters are
                determined based on the risk profile of the collateral, and are directly
                controlled by NAI holders through voting.</p>
            <h5>The Key Risk Parameters for KANAI Vaults are:</h5>
            <p>
            <ul>● <b>Debt Ceiling:</b> A Debt Ceiling is the maximum amount of debt that can
                be created by a single collateral type. KANAI Governance assigns every
                collateral type a Debt Ceiling, which is used to ensure sufficient
                diversification of the KANAI Protocol collateral portfolio. Once a
                collateral type has reached its Debt Ceiling, it becomes impossible to
                create more debt unless some existing users pay back all or a portion of
                their Vault debt.<br>
                ● <b>Stability Fee:</b> The Stability Fee is an annual percentage yield
                calculated on top of how much USTEBO has been generated against a
                Vault’s collateral. The fee is paid in USTEBO only, and then sent into the
                KANAI Buffer.<br>
                ● <b>Liquidation Ratio:</b> A low Liquidation Ratio means KANAI Governance
                expects low price volatility of the collateral; a high Liquidation Ratio
                means high volatility is expected.<br>
                ● <b>Liquidation Penalty:</b> The Liquidation Penalty is a fee added to a
                Vault’s total outstanding generated USTEBO when a Liquidation occurs.
                The Liquidation Penalty is used to encourage Vault owners to keep
                appropriate collateral levels.<br>
                ● <b>Collateral Auction Duration:</b> The maximum duration of Collateral
                auctions is specific to KANAI Vaults. Debt and Surplus auction durations
                are global system parameters.<br>
                ● <b>Auction Bid Duration:</b> Amount of time before an individual bid expires
                and closes the auction.<br>
                ● <b>Auction Step Size:</b> This Risk Parameter exists to incentivize early
                bidders in auctions, and prevent abuse by bidding a tiny amount above
                an existing bid.</ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Risk and Mitigation Responsibilities of Governance</h4>
            <p>The successful operation of the KANAI Protocol depends on KANAI
                Governance taking necessary steps to mitigate risks. Some of those risks are
                identified below, each followed by a mitigation plan.</p>
            <h5>A malicious attack on the smart contract infrastructure by a bad actor.</h5>
            <p>One of the greatest risks to the KANAI Protocol is a malicious actor—a
                programmer, for example, who discovers a vulnerability in the deployed smart
                contracts, and then uses it to break the Protocol or steal from it. In the worst-case scenario, all
                decentralized digital assets held as collateral in
                the Protocol are stolen, and recovery is impossible.</p>
            <p><b>Mitigation:</b> The KANAI Foundation's highest priority is the security of the
                KANAI Protocol and the strongest defense of the Protocol is Formal
                Verification. In addition to formal system verification, contracted security audits by the best
                security organizations in the blockchain industry, third-party
                (independent) audits, and bug bounties are part of the Foundation's security roadmap. These security
                measures provide a strong defense system; however, they are
                not infallible. Even with formal verification, the mathematical modeling of
                intended behaviors may be incorrect, or the assumptions behind the intended
                behavior itself may be incorrect. </p>
            <h5>A black swan event</h5>
            <p>A black swan event is a rare and critical surprise attack on a system. For the
                KANAI Protocol, examples of a black swan event include:<br>
            <ul> ● An attack on the collateral types that back USTEBO.<br>
                ● A large, unexpected price decrease of one or more collateral types.<br>
                ● A highly coordinated Oracle attack.<br>
                ● A malicious KANAI Governance proposal.</ul>
            </p>
            <p>Please note that this list of potential "black swans" is not exhaustive and not
                intended to capture the extent of such possibilities.</p>
            <p><b>Mitigation:</b> While no one solution is failsafe, the careful design of the KANAI
                Protocol (the Liquidation Ratio, Debt Ceilings, the Governance Security
                Module, the Oracle Security Module, Emergency Shutdown, etc.) in
                conjunction with good governance (e.g., swift reaction in a crisis, thoughtful
                risk parameters, etc.) help to prevent or mitigate potentially severe
                consequences of an attack.</p>
            <h5>Unforeseen pricing errors and market irrationality</h5>
            <p>Oracle price feed problems or irrational market dynamics that cause variations
                in the price of USTEBO for an extended period of time can occur. If confidence
                in the system is lost, rate adjustments or even NAI dilution could reach
                extreme levels and still not bring enough liquidity and stability to the market.</p>
            <p><b>Mitigation:</b> KANAI Governance incentivizes a sufficiently large capital pool to
                act as Keepers of the market in order to maximize rationality and market
                efficiency, and allow the USTEBO supply to grow at a steady pace without
                major market shocks. As a last resort, Emergency Shutdown can be triggered
                to release collateral to USTEBO holders, with their USTEBO claims valued at
                the Target Price.</p>
            <h5>User Abandonment for Less Complicated Solutions</h5>
            <p>The KANAI Protocol is a complex decentralized system. As a result of its
                complexity, there is a risk that inexperienced cryptocurrency users will
                abandon the Protocol in favor of systems that may be easier to use and
                understand.</p>
            <p><b>Mitigation:</b> While USTEBO is easy to generate and use for most crypto
                enthusiasts and the Keepers that use it for margin trading, newcomers might
                find the Protocol difficult to understand and navigate. Although USTEBO is
                designed in such a way that users need not comprehend the underlying
                mechanics of the KANAI Protocol in order to benefit from it, the guidance
                consistently provided by the KANAI community and the KANAI Foundation
                help to ensure onboarding is as uncomplicated as possible.</p>
            <h5>Dissolution of The KANAI Foundation</h5>
            <p>The KANAI Foundation currently plays a role, along with independent actors,
                in maintaining the KANAI Protocol and expanding its usage worldwide, while
                facilitating Governance. However, the KANAI Foundation plans to dissolve
                once KANAIDAO can manage Governance completely on its own. Should
                KANAIDAO fail to sufficiently take the reins upon the KANAI Foundation's
                dissolution, the future health of the KANAI Protocol could be at risk.</p>
            <p><b>Mitigation:</b> NAI holders are incentivized to prepare for the Foundation's
                dissolution after it completes "gradual decentralization" of the project.
                Moreover, successful management of the system should result in sufficient
                funds for governance to allocate to the continued maintenance and
                improvement of the KANAI Protocol.</p>
            <h5>General Issues with Experimental Technology</h5>
            <p>Users of the KANAI Protocol (including but not limited to USTEBO and NAI
                holders) understand and accept that the software, technology, and technical
                concepts and theories applicable to the KANAI Protocol are still unproven and
                there is no warranty that the technology will be uninterrupted or error-free.
                There is an inherent risk that the technology could contain weaknesses,
                vulnerabilities, or bugs causing, among other things, the complete failure of
                the KANAI Protocol and/or its component parts.<br>
                <b>Mitigation:</b> See “A malicious attack on the smart contract infrastructure by a
                bad actor” above. The Mitigation section there explains the technical auditing
                in place to ensure the KANAI Protocol functions as intended.
            </p>
            <h3>Price Stability Mechanisms</h3>
            <h5>The USTEBO Target Price</h5>
            <p>The USTEBO Target Price is used to determine the value of collateral assets
                USTEBO holders receive in the case of an Emergency Shutdown. The Target
                Price for USTEBO is 1 USD, translating to a 1:1 USD soft peg.</p>
            <h5>Emergency Shutdown</h5>
            <p>Emergency Shutdown (or, simply, Shutdown) serves two main purposes.
                First, it is used during emergencies as a last-resort mechanism to protect the
                KANAI Protocol against attacks on its infrastructure and directly enforce the
                USTEBO Target Price. Emergencies could include malicious governance
                actions, hacking, security breaches, and long-term market irrationality.<br>Second,<br>Shutdown is used
                to facilitate a KANAI Protocol system upgrade. The
                Shutdown process can only be controlled by KANAI Governance.</p>
            <p>NAI voters are also able to instantly trigger an Emergency Shutdown by
                depositing NAI into the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM), if enough NAI
                voters believe it is necessary. This prevents the Governance Security Module
                (if active) from delaying Shutdown proposals before they are executed. With
                Emergency Shutdown, the moment a quorum is reached, the Shutdown takes
                effect with no delay.</p>
            <h5>There are three phases of Emergency Shutdown:</h5>
            <ol>1. <b>The KANAI Protocol shuts down; Vault owners withdraw assets.</b><br>
                When initiated, Shutdown prevents further Vault creation and
                manipulation of existing Vaults, and freezes the Price Feeds. The frozen
                feeds ensure that all users are able to withdraw the net value of assets
                to which they are entitled. Effectively, it allows KANAI Vault owners to
                immediately withdraw the collateral in their Vault that is not actively
                backing debt.</ol>
            <ol>2. <b>Post-Emergency Shutdown auction processing</b><br>
                After Shutdown is triggered, Collateral Auctions begin and must be
                completed within a specific amount of time. That time period is
                determined by Governance to be slightly longer than the duration of the longest Collateral Auction. This
                guarantees that no auctions are
                outstanding at the end of the auction processing period.</ol>
            <ol>3. <b>USTEBO holders claim their remaining collatera</b><br>
                At the end of the auction processing period, USTEBO holders use their
                USTEBO to claim collateral directly at a fixed rate that corresponds to
                the calculated value of their assets based on the USTEBO Target Price.
                For example, if the ETH/USD Price Ratio is 200, and a user holds 1000
                USTEBO at the Target Price of 1 USD when Emergency Shutdown is
                activated, The user will be able to claim exactly 5 ETH from the KANAI
                Protocol after the auction processing period. There is no time limit for
                when a final claim can be made. USTEBO holders will get a
                proportional claim to each collateral type that exists in the collateral
                portfolio. Note that USTEBO holders could be at risk of a haircut,
                whereby they do not receive the full value of their USTEBO holdings at
                the Target Price of 1 USD per USTEBO. This is due to risks related to
                declines in collateral value and to Vault owners having the right to
                retrieve their excess collateral before USTEBO holders may claim the
                remaining collateral.</ol>
            <h3>The Future of the KANAI Protocol: Increased
                Adoption and Full Decentralization</h3>
            <h5>Addressable Market</h5>
            <p>A cryptocurrency with price stability serves as an important medium of
                exchange for many decentralized applications. As such, the potential market
                for USTEBO is at least as large as the entire decentralized blockchain
                industry. But the promise of USTEBO extends well beyond that into other
                industries.</p>
            <p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of current and immediate markets for the
                USTEBO stablecoin:</p>
            <ul>1.<b> Working capital, hedging, and collateralized leverage. </b>KANAI Vaults
                allow for permissionless trading by users, who can use the USTEBO
                generated against Vault collateral for working capital. There will be
                numerous instances where Vault owners use their USTEBO to buy additional ETH (same asset as their
                collateral), thereby creating a
                leveraged but fully collateralized position.</ul>
            <ul>2. <b>Merchant receipts, cross-border transactions, and remittances.</b> F
                oreign exchange volatility mitigation and a lack of intermediaries mean
                the transaction costs of international trade are significantly reduced
                when using USTEBO.</ul>
            <ul>3. <b>Charities and NGOs</b>. when using transparent distributed ledger
                technology.</ul>
            <ul>4. <b>Gaming</b>. For blockchain game developers, USTEBO is the currency of
                choice. With USTEBO, game developers integrate not only a currency,
                but also an entire economy. The composability of USTEBO allows
                games to create new player behavior schemes based around
                decentralized finance.</ul>
            <ul>5. <b>Prediction markets</b>. Using a volatile cryptocurrency when making an
                unrelated prediction only increases one’s risk when placing the bet.
                Long-term bets become especially infeasible if the bettor must also
                gamble on the future price of the volatile asset used to place the bet.
                That said, the USTEBO stablecoin would be a natural choice for use in
                prediction markets.</ul>
            <h5>Asset Expansion</h5>
            <p>Should NAI holders approve new assets as collateral, those assets will be
                subject to the same risk requirements, parameters, and safety measures as
                USTEBO (e.g., Liquidation Ratios, Stability Fees, Savings Rates, Debt
                Ceilings, etc.).</p>
            <h5>Evolving Oracles</h5>
            <p>KANAIDAO project will run reliable Oracles on the Ethereum blockchain. As a
                result, many decentralized applications will use KANAIDAO Oracles to ensure
                the security of their systems and to provide up-to-date price data in a robust
                manner. This confidence in KANAIDAO and the KANAI Protocol means that
                KANAI Governance can expand the core Oracle infrastructure service to
                better suit the needs of decentralized applications.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The KANAI Protocol allows users to generate USTEBO, a stable store of value
                that lives entirely on the blockchain. USTEBO is a decentralized stablecoin
                that is not issued or administered by any centralized actor or trusted
                intermediary or counterparty. It is unbiased and borderless —available to
                anyone, anywhere.</p>
            <p>All USTEBO is backed by a surplus of collateral that has been individually
                escrowed and publicly viewable Ethereum smart contracts. Anyone with an
                internet connection can monitor the health of the system anytime.</p>
            <p>With hundreds of targeted partnerships and one of the strongest developer
                communities in the cryptocurrency space, KANAIDAO will become the engine
                of the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement. KANAI will unlock the power of
                the blockchain to deliver on the promise of economic empowerment today.</p>
            <h3>APPENDIX</h3>
            <h4>USTEBO Use-Case Benefits and Examples</h4>
            <p>The KANAI Protocol can be used by anyone, anywhere, without any
                restrictions or personal-information requirements. Below are a few examples
                of how USTEBO will be used around the world:</p>
            <h5>USTEBO Offers Financial Independence to All</h5>
            <p>According to the World Bank’s Global Findex Database 2017, about 1.7 billion
                adults around the world are unbanked. In the US alone, according to a 2017
                survey by the FDIC, around 32 million American households are either
                unbanked or underbanked, meaning that they either have no bank account at
                all or they regularly use alternatives to traditional banking (e.g., payday or
                pawn shop loans) to manage their finances. USTEBO can empower every one
                of those people; all they need is access to the internet.</p>
            <p>As the world’s unbiased stablecoin, USTEBO allows anyone to achieve
                financial independence, regardless of their location or circumstances. For
                example, in Latin America, Asia and Africa, USTEBO will provide an opportunity for individuals and
                families to hedge against the devaluation of
                their currencies.</p>
            <h5>Self-Sovereign Money Generation</h5>
            <p>KANAI Protocol allows users to generate USTEBO by locking their collateral in
                a KANAI Vault. Notably, users do not need to access any third-party
                intermediary to generate USTEBO. Vaults offer individuals and businesses
                opportunities to create liquidity on their assets simply, quickly, and at relatively
                low cost.</p>
            <h5>Savings Earned Automatically</h5>
            <p>USTEBO holders everywhere can better power their journeys to financial
                inclusion by taking advantage of the USTEBO Savings Rate, which, as
                detailed earlier, builds on the value of USTEBO by allowing users to earn on
                the USTEBO they hold and protect their savings from inflation.</p>
            <p>For example, if Alice has 100,000 USTEBO locked in the USR contract, and
                the USR set by KANAI Governance is 6% per year, Alice will earn savings of
                6,000 USTEBO over 12 months. Additionally, because exchanges and
                blockchain projects can integrate the USR into their own platforms, it presents
                new opportunities for cryptocurrency traders, entrepreneurs, and established
                businesses to increase their USTEBO savings and USTEBO operating capital.
                Due to this attractive mechanism, Market Makers, for example, may choose to
                hold their idle inventory in USTEBO and lock it in the USR.</p>
            <h5>Fast, Low-cost Remittances</h5>
            <p>Cross-border remittances, whether for the purchase of goods or services or to
                simply send money to family and friends, can mean high service and transfer
                fees, long delivery timelines, and frustrating exchange issues due to inflation.
                The USTEBO stablecoin is used around the world as a medium of exchange
                because of confidence in its value and efficiency.</p>
            <p>Remittance users will benefit from USTEBO in the following ways:
            <ul>● Low-cost domestic and international transfers. USTEBO provides
                immediate cost savings, as low gas fees replace high bank and wire
                service fees. Low cost allows for more frequent transactions.<br>
                ● Anytime service. USTEBO doesn’t rely on bank-like hours of
                operation. The KANAI Protocol can be accessed 24/7/365.<br>
                ● Convenient on/off ramps. Users can take advantage of the many fiat
                on and off ramps that exchange fiat currencies to USTEBO. These
                options allow users to bridge the gap between the fiat and
                cryptocurrency world, and easily cash out USTEBO holdings in their
                local currencies.<br>
                ● Increased security and confidence. The blockchain offers high level
                of security and consumer trust.</ul>
            </p>
            <h5>Stability in Volatile Markets</h5>
            <p>As noted above, USTEBO is both a readily accessible store of value and a
                powerful medium of exchange. As such, it can help protect traders from
                volatility. For example, it provides traders with a simple way to maneuver
                between positions smoothly and remain active in the market without having to
                cash out and repeat an on-ramp/off-ramp cycle.</p>
            <h3>USTEBO as an Ecosystem Driver and DeFi Builder</h3>
            <p>As more and more users become aware of USTEBO’s value as a stablecoin,
                more developers are integrating it into the dapps they build on the Ethereum
                blockchain. As such, USTEBO will help to power a more robust ecosystem. In
                short, USTEBO allows dapp developers to offer a stable method of exchange
                to their users who would rather not buy and sell goods and services using
                speculative assets.</p>
            <p>Additionally, because USTEBO can be used to pay for gas in the Ethereum
                ecosystem, by creating DeFi dapps that accept USTEBO instead of ETH,
                developers offer users a smoother onboarding experience and a better overall
                experience.</p>
